# JNTUACEK Sports Club — Prototype

This is a small static prototype for a sports club app (UI + simple profile/login). It demonstrates a professional, soft palette design using cream, pale pink, and ivory. The prototype includes Cricket, Kabaddi, Kho-Kho, Volleyball, and Badminton.

What’s included
- `index.html` — main page and UI
- `css/styles.css` — styles and palette
- `js/app.js` — simple client-side profile handling (localStorage)

How to run
1. Open `index.html` in your browser (double-click or right-click -> Open with > your browser).
2. Click "Create Profile" or "Login / Profile" to create a profile. The profile is stored in your browser's Local Storage (no backend).

Notes & next steps
- This is a static prototype. Next steps if you want a full app:
  - Add a backend (Node/Express, Firebase, or similar) for real auth and data persistence.
  - Add sport-specific pages with schedules, squads and image galleries.
  - Add user avatar upload and password recovery.

Design choices
- Colors: cream, pale pink, ivory — chosen for a professional, soft aesthetic.
- Focus: clear typographic hierarchy, spacious cards and approachable CTAs.

If you want, I can:
- Convert this prototype to React/Vite and add routes for each sport.
- Add a simple Firebase Auth and Firestore integration for persistent profiles.
- Create Figma-style mockups (PNG/SVG) or export handoff assets.
